# Hey, I’m [Abdulrahman Azmy](https://www.abuazmy.online)  

I’m an 18-year-old Python dev from Egypt, obsessed with building things that work—and work well. I cut my teeth on web dev with HTML5, CSS, and JS, but I’m not here to mess around with basic CRUD apps. I’m digging into Rust for its raw performance and wrestling with AI/ML to solve problems that actually matter. Code’s my toolbox; impact’s my goal.

## What I Bring to the Table  

- **Python**:  
  I wield it like a Swiss Army knife—clean, efficient, and ready for anything from scripts to full-stack systems.  
- **Git & GitHub**:  
  Version control’s second nature; I’ve got branching, PRs, and CI/CD workflows locked down.  
- **Web Stack (HTML5, CSS, JS)**:  
  Responsive, performant frontends—no janky layouts or bloated frameworks here.

## What I’m Grinding On  

- **SvelteKit**:  
  Lightweight, reactive UIs that don’t make me hate JavaScript.  
- **Rust**:  
  Systems-level control with zero compromises—memory safety’s my jam.  
- **AI/ML**:  
  From neural nets to optimization, I’m chasing the edge of what machines can do.
